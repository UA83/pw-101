          # ⚠️ FIX: If you have a requirements.txt, use this line:
          #pip install -r requirements.txt

          # ⚠️ ALTERNATIVE: If you don't have requirements.txt, use this line instead:
          pip install pytest pytest-playwright

          # Install Playwright's required web browser executables (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
          playwright install
